        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>The development of "Revenge of Lights Out" was a captivating journey that blended creativity and problem-solving skills. Our goal was to create an immersive and entertaining experience for players while incorporating unique design elements.</p>
      
        <h3>Creative Choices:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grid Selection:</strong> The 5x5 grid was carefully chosen to strike a balance between complexity and accessibility, ensuring a challenging yet enjoyable gameplay experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> The minimalist user interface was designed to prioritize gameplay while incorporating modern design principles, creating a sleek and visually appealing environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Rewarding Feedback:</strong> The modal window announcing game completion was implemented to provide players with a satisfying sense of accomplishment and a clear indication of their success.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Randomization:</strong> Implementing an effective randomization algorithm for the board setup was a significant challenge. This was overcome by developing a sophisticated shuffling function that ensures a unique and solvable game state for each session.</li>
          <li><strong>Solvability:</strong> Ensuring that the game remained solvable after randomization was a complex task. Through rigorous testing and tweaking of the shuffling algorithm, we were able to guarantee solvability while maintaining the desired level of challenge.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Insights Gained:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User-Centric Approach:</strong> Throughout the development process, we realized the paramount importance of keeping the user experience at the forefront. Simple, intuitive gameplay and a well-designed interface significantly enhance player engagement and overall satisfaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterative Testing:</strong> Rigorous and iterative testing proved invaluable in identifying and resolving gameplay and usability issues. This experience reinforced the significance of thorough testing in game development, ensuring a polished and enjoyable final product.</li>
