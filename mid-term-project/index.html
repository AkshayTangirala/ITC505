      <h2>Addendum</h2>
      <h2><strong>Process:</strong></h2> 
      <p>The game is structured using a finite state machine approach, where each state represents a stage in the game's narrative.</p>
      <p>The gameData object holds information about each state, including the text to display, available choices, consequences of those choices, and associated images.</p>
      <p>Two main functions, startGame() and updatePage(), handle game initialization and updating the display, respectively.</p>
      
      <h2>Creative Choices:</h2>
      <p>The game theme revolves around elemental paths, Earth and Sky, offering players distinct choices and consequences.</p>
      <p>Each state is designed to immerse players in a vivid environment, featuring descriptive text and accompanying images to enhance the storytelling experience.</p>
      <p>Endings are tailored to reflect the player's choices, offering a sense of accomplishment and closure.</p>
      
      <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
      <p><strong>Dynamic Content Rendering: </strong> Dynamically updating the page content based on player choices posed a challenge, particularly managing transitions between states seamlessly.</p>
      <p><strong>Event Handling:</strong>Ensuring smooth event handling for player choices and updating the game state accordingly required careful attention to event listeners and callback functions.</p>
      <p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Handling image resources efficiently, including loading and displaying images without causing performance issues, was crucial.</p>
      
      <h2>How Challenges Were Overcome:</h2>
      <p><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Breaking down the game logic into modular functions aided in better organization and debugging, mitigating issues related to event handling and state transitions.</p>
      <p><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Rigorous testing and debugging were conducted at each stage of development to identify and address issues promptly.</p>
      <p><strong>Optimization: </strong> Optimizing resource loading and updating strategies helped maintain smooth gameplay without sacrificing performance.</p>
       
      <h2>Insights Gained: </h2>
      <p><strong>User Experience: </strong> Understanding the importance of immersive storytelling and engaging visuals in enhancing the user experience.</p>
      <p><strong>State Management: </strong> Appreciating the significance of effective state management in interactive applications, facilitating dynamic content updates and player progression.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Feedback Loop: </strong> Recognising the value of iterative development and user feedback in refining and improving the game experience over time.</p>
